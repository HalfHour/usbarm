These are some impotant things to keep in mind:

- There might be some peripheral conflict since some/all GPIO are multiplexed.

Here is how thing are done and what are the bad things that could happen.
The first time you ask STM32F103 class for something, it will configure everything
and the instance returned is guaranteed to work. However, it will not configure it
again as long as the program is running. So if you have two different peripheral 
that are using the same IOs, as soon has you ask for the second one, the first 
one will stop working.

- External interrupts can only work on one GPIO port at a time.

If you add a listener on let say GPIOA pin 1. The pin will bind the external
interrupts to port A and will then activate the pin 1 interrupt. If later in
the program you add a listener to GPIOB pin 5, the pin will bind the external
interrupts to port B. In that case, the GPIOA pin 1 will stop receiving interrupts.
This is a hardware limitation. On the other hand, up to every pin of a port
can receive external interrupt.
